Commands
--------

```
hubot pick (an) assignee (for) <ISSUE-NUMBER> from <ASSIGNEE-GROUP>
```

This command picks an assignee for the issue randomly from `<ASSIGNEE-GROUP>`.

Random logic is weighted with number of issues in same project already assigned to.

Configuration
-------------

<%= partial '2014-07-24-hubot-jira-lotto/configuration.sh.md' %>

This Hubot script require **Admin priviledges** for the login account.

Please add the login account to *administrators* group.


Converting JIRA username to chat username to mention
----------------------------------------------------

If you use different username in your adapter (Campfire, HipChat, Slack ...) and JIRA, you can define converter method in `robot` instance.

eg: map `ngs` to `atsushi_nagase`
