I‚Äôve published initial version of [Scrapmd], an app that clips webpage content into iCloud Drive with Markdown formatted article body and embedded images.

[![](images/appstore.svg)][appstore]

Originally, this app was available to clip any webpage all around the World Wide Web, but the feature was rejected due to conflicting legal property:

> Guideline 5.2.3 - Legal - Intellectual Property
>
> Your app allows users to save or download music, video, or other media content without authorization from the relevant third-party sources.

So I changed this app to check web pages containing custom attribute that indicates allow Scrapmd to clip their content.

```html
<div data-scrapmd-ok="ok">
```

This was unintentional feature for usability but better than keep the app private for me.

I will opt-in allowing full functionality **PERSONALLY**.

The app and its backend API source code are open in [GitHub].

You can fork and build this app and use full feature personally like me.

Feature proposals or pull requests are welcomed, fell free to send some.

Happy Scrapping üç¢
