I‚Äôve published initial version of [Scrapmd], that clips web page content into iCloud Drive with Markdown formatted article text and embedded images.

In first time submitted this app, this app clips any webpage all around the World Wide Web, but the feature was rejected due to conflicting legal property:

> Guideline 5.2.3 - Legal - Intellectual Property
>
> Your app allows users to save or download music, video, or other media content without authorization from the relevant third-party sources.

So I changed this app to check web pages containing custom attribute that indicates allow Scrapmd to clip their content.

```html
<div data-scrapmd-ok="ok">
```

This was unintentional feature for usability but better than keep the app private for me.

I will opt-in allowing full functionality **PERSONALLY**.

App and its backend API source code is open in GitHub.

You can fork and build this app and use full feature personally like me.

Feature proposals or pull requests are welcomed, fell free to send some.

Happy Scrapping üç¢
