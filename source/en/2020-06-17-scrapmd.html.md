I‚Äôve published initial version of [Scrapmd], an app that clips webpage content into iCloud Drive with Markdown formatted article body and embedded images.

## Motivation

I have used to gather webpage URLs and its content on Social Bookmarking Service (Like [del.icio.us] or [Hatena Bookmarks]), Self-hosted [Lobsteres] (OSS bookmarking service, mine is [b.ngs.io]), Slack channels and Evernote.

But I've thought those are not quite reliable (some of those shut down) so I started building File System based Web Clipping application.

## How it worked

![](2020-06-17-scrapmd/screen.gif)

**Originally**, the app was available to clip any webpage all around the World Wide Web.

Clip from browser share menu, direct URL input or URL in users' pasteboard.

## App Store Rejection

First time I submitted the app, unfortunately, that was rejected due to the feature is conflicting legal property:

> Guideline 5.2.3 - Legal - Intellectual Property
>
> Your app allows users to save or download music, video, or other media content without authorization from the relevant third-party sources.

ref: [App Store Review Guidelines 5.2.3]

## Solution

So I changed this app to check webpages containing custom attribute that indicates allow Scrapmd to clip their content.

```html
<div data-scrapmd-ok="ok">
```

This was unintentional feature for usability but better than keep the app private for me.

I will opt-in allowing full functionality **PERSONALLY**.

## Full Open Sourced

The app and its backend API source code are hosted publicly on [GitHub].

You can fork and build this app and use full feature personally like me.

Feature proposals or pull requests are welcomed, fell free to send some.

Happy Scrapping üç¢
