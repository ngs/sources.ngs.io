I created a [middleman-blog] extension to lookup similar articles.

View **[middleman-blog-similar on GitHub][middleman-blog-similar]**.

<%= partial 'partials/2014-05-11-middleman-blog-similar/Gemfile.html.md' %>

<%= partial 'partials/2014-05-11-middleman-blog-similar/layout.slim.html.md' %>

You can retrieve similar articles from `similar_articles` helper method or `Middleman::Blog::BlogArticle#similar_articles` instance method.

Currently this extension supports similarity engines: [levenshtein-ffi], [levenshtein] and [damerau-levenshtein].

However, I think those are bit low accuracy, so I'm tring to create engines with [tf-idf-similarity] library.

Pull request: **[[wip] tf*idf support #2][pr]**

You will be able to choose similarity engines like the below in your `config.rb`:
