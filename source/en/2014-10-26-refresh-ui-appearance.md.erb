I was looking for how to apply changes made with UIAppearance's proxy method immediately.

I found a solution in a library [UISS], that handles Stylesheets written with JSON format.

<%= partial '2014-10-26-refresh-ui-appearance/refreshViews.m.md' %>

This code detaches all subviews of `window` and attach them again.

I also tried `setNeedsDisplay` and `setNeedsLayout`, but didn't work. So I adapted this hack.

Here is Swift version.
