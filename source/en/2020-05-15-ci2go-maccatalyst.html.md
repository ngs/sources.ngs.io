I've published [CI2Go] the CircleCI client for macOS by porting existing iOS app using [Mac Catalyst].

Both iOS and macOS versions are available on App Store in same URL.

iPad Keyboard shortcuts are supported from this update.

You can use <kbd>&#x2318; \[</kbd> to back navigation, <kbd>&#x2318; R</kbd> to reload and <kbd>&#8997; &#8679;„ÄÄ&#x2318; L</kbd> to logout.

## WIP: Workflows

CircleCI [Workflows] are not yet completely supported but already in future milestones.

## Under The Hood

![](2020-05-15-ci2go-maccatalyst/workflow.png)

Of course, I've setup Mac Catalyst app Continuous Delivery as well as iOS version.

Also, I've migrated package management from [Carthage] to [Swift Package Manager].

These are managed in public [GitHub repository] so anyone can refer.

Hope this could help other developers to try building the Mac Catalyst app on CircleCI like me.

I did some workarounds like the follows.

- Swift Package build fails on macOS platform if containing Build Dependencies
  - Like: `multiple configured targets of 'KeychainAccess' are being created for macOS`
  - Duplicated build target and removed them.
  - ref: [Swift PM app in Xcode 11 (beta 5) gets four ‚ÄúMy Mac‚Äù platform options]
- [fastlane match] can not create Provisioning Profile for Mac Catalyst.

  - Creates for Mac when providing `platform: 'macos'`
  - Set `skip_provisioning_profiles` to `true`, added `.provisioningprofile` files to version control and copy them to `~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles/` on CI build step.

    ```rb
    match(
      type: 'development',
      app_identifier: %w(com.ci2go.ios.Circle),
      skip_provisioning_profiles: true,
      platform: 'macos'
    )
    ```

- [fastlane deliver] rejects iOS app binary with `reject_if_possible: true` even if `platform` is set to `osx`.
  - Set `reject_if_possible` to `false` in Mac platform settings and reject manually if I need to select new build for now.
- [fastlane deliver] fails submitting Mac app for review.

  - [Spaceship] fails handling App Store Connect API response.
  - ref: [tunes_client.rb]
  - `rescue` d the exception.

    ```rb
    rescue NoMethodError => e
      puts e
      raise e unless e.message == %q(undefined method `fetch' for nil:NilClass)
      puts "... Caught error, but omitting"
    end
    ```
