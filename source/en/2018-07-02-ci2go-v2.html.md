I've just released major updated version 2.0.0 of [CI2Go], the [CircleCI] client for iPhone and iPad.

[![](images/appstore.svg)][AppStore]

V2 contains the following updates.

## iPhone X Support

Started supporting iPhone X's 5.8 inches screen.

## Single Sign-on Support

![](images/2018-07-02-ci2go-v2/sso.gif)

Update authentication flow to use Single Sign-on instead of Copy and Pasting API Tokens from CircleCI.

This creates [Personal API Token] internally.

## Build Artifacts Browser

Redesigned Build Artifacts Browser.

You can browse artifacts more quickly without waiting for downloading entire files.

This app starts downloading when you tried to view file and continues downloading in background.

## Apple Watch Complications

Supported Apple Watch [Complications].

You can add your build status in your watch face.

Due to watchOS API limitation, this does not update information realtime.

## Performance improvement

In this version, I've redesigned entire implementation from scratch.

Behaves more swift instead of dealing with offline data.

Send me [issues] if you have any.
