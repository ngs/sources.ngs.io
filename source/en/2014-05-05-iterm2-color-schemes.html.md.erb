I started to manage stuffs with [dotfiles] git repository instead of [Boxen].

I managed iTerm 2 color schemes with [puppet-iterm2] modules, that was very useful.

To migrate to [dotfiles], I wrote the following scripts to export/import iTerm 2 color schemes.

### Exporting:

This exports color schemes configured in your iTerm 2.

<%= partial 'partials/2014-05-05-iterm2-color-schemes/import.sh.html.md' %>

### Importing:

<%= partial 'partials/2014-05-05-iterm2-color-schemes/export.sh.html.md' %>

[Boxen]: http://boxen.github.com/
[dotfiles]: https://github.com/ngs/dotfiles/
[puppet-iterm2]: https://github.com/ngs/puppet-iterm2
