I created [3 Hubot scripts] and published to [npm][npm], however I worried about that there are no unit tests with them.

So I configured them unit tests with [gulp] and [mocha].

READMORE

package.json
------------

I added the following npm packages to `devDependencies`:

<%= partial '2014-06-13-tdd-hubot-scripts/package.json.md' %>

Require modules for testing
---------------------------

I use:

- **[Chai Assertion Library]** to use `expect` matcher.
- **[nock]** to mock HTTP responses.

In the top of `yourscript_spec.coffee`:

<%= partial '2014-06-13-tdd-hubot-scripts/require.coffee.md' %>

The mock Hubot adapter
------------------

**[hubot-mock-adapter]** is a simple Hubot adapter that just emits events: `send`, `reply`, `topic`, `play` immediately.

Create [Robot] instance with `mock-adapter`.

<%= partial '2014-06-13-tdd-hubot-scripts/new-robot.coffee.md' %>

This means:

- Loads adapter from npm modules.
- Uses [hubot-mock-adapter].
- HTTP server is on.
- Responds to messages with `TestHubot ...` prefix.

Load your script
----------------

To load scripts to test, call `Robot:loadFile`.

This method loads listeners and parses command helps written in comment.

Loading adapter should be connected to data source. So call them in `connected` event handler.

<%= partial '2014-06-13-tdd-hubot-scripts/robot-load-file.coffee.md' %>

`hubot help` command is implemented in [help.coffee].


Test help commands
------------------

`Robot:loadFile` method loads scripts to parse command helps to list in help asynchronously.

So you need to wait for commands to be actually loaded before exit the scope.

<%= partial '2014-06-13-tdd-hubot-scripts/wait-for-help.coffee.md' %>

then you can describe help response.

<%= partial '2014-06-13-tdd-hubot-scripts/describe-help.coffee.md' %>

[Hubot v2.7.5] has a bug with help parser that adds prefix twice.

I fixed it and sent a [pull request#712] that was merged. (not yet published to npm.)

Catch exceptions in event handler
---------------------------------

On test failure in event handlers, `chai.AssertionError` might be thrown in event handlers and that kills process by default.

It needs to `try catch` and done with error if caught errors.

<%= partial '2014-06-13-tdd-hubot-scripts/try-catch.coffee.md' %>

Mock HTTP
---------

I use [nock] that overrides native [http.ClientRequest] module to responses mock data.

<%= partial '2014-06-13-tdd-hubot-scripts/nock-post-reply.coffee.md' %>

[nock] also avoids all HTTP requests, call `nock.disableNetConnect()` on `beforeEach`.

<%= partial '2014-06-13-tdd-hubot-scripts/nock-disable-net-connect.coffee.md' %>

For more details, read [nock documentation].

Clean stuff on afterEach
------------------------

### Close HTTP server

`Error: listen EADDRINUSE` will occur without closing [express] server.

<%= partial '2014-06-13-tdd-hubot-scripts/robot-server-close.coffee.md' %>

### Clean HTTP mocking

If you test error handling, same error will occur other again without calling `nock.cleanAll()`.

<%= partial '2014-06-13-tdd-hubot-scripts/nock-clean-all.coffee.md' %>

gulpfile.coffee
---------------

From version 3.7.0, gulp supports gulpfiles written in CoffeeScript.

gulp watch exits on test failure
--------------------------------

[gulp-watch] exits on test failure by default.

To prevent this, emit `end` event in error handler like the below:

<%= partial '2014-06-13-tdd-hubot-scripts/gulp-watch.coffee.md' %>

Make sure `mocha` pipe should pipe to `coffee` pipe.
