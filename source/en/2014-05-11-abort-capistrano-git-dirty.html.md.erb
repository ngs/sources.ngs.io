I configured Capistrano 2 to abort deployment if remote directory is dirty.

Because uncommited changes in remote directory will cause degrade.

\# Of course, modifying source code in remote directory is bad, but sometimes we need to do it.

If there are some changes in remote, deploy log would be like this:

<%= partial 'partials/2014-05-11-abort-capistrano-git-dirty/cap.log.html.md' %>

## Capistano 3

Capistrano 3 doesn't clone repository for each releases so we can't port this task.

I'm seeking other solution to protect remote changes from automated deployments.
