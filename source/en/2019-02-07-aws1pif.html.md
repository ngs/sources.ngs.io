[ngs/aws1pif](https://github.com/ngs/aws1pif)

## Install

You can install aws1pif using Homebrew or `go install` command

```sh
brew install ngs/formulae/aws1pif
```

or

```sh
go install github.com/ngs/aws1pif
```

## How to Use

`aws1pif` converts CSV standard input to .1pif JSON file format as standard output.

```sh
cat ~/Downloads/credentials.csv | aws1pif > aws.1pif
```

1Password will launch when opening .1pif file and show confirmation dialog

Currently CSV with multiple credentials is not supported.
