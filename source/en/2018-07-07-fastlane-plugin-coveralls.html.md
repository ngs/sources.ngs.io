I've just published a [fastlane]&nbsp;[plugin] that sends Xcode code coverage to [Coveralls] and its depending library [xccoveralls] that also works as standalone command line tool.

- [ngs/fastlane-plugin-coveralls][plugin]
- [ngs/xccoveralls][xccoveralls]

## Quick Start

Run the following command

```sh
fastlane add_plugin coveralls
```

Add the following line to your `Fastfile`

```rb
lane :send_coveralls do
  coveralls
end
```

Make sure `Code Coverage` checkbox is turned on for your test target.

Then you can send coverage data from `fastlane` command

```sh
export XCCOVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN=... # grab yours from Coveralls.io
bundle exec fastlane send_coveralls
```

You can check [CI2Go] coverage on [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/ngs/ci2go) and [Fastfile](https://github.com/ngs/ci2go/blob/master/fastlane/Fastfile#L119-L124).

## Motivation

I tried to introduce [Xcov] which is built into [fastlane action][xcov action], but it does not send covered lines because it uses `.xccovreport` or `.xccoverage` file which contains only summary of test coverage.

So I started implementing with `xcrun xccov` which was introduced in Xcode 9.3.

```sh
# List files
$ xcrun xccov view --file-list DerivedData/Logs/Build/*.xccovarchive

# Code coverage for specific file
$ xcrun xccov view --file /Users/ngs/src/CI2Go/AppDelegate.swift \
    DerivedData/Logs/Build/*.xccovarchive
```
