## Today widget

You can add CI2Go widget to [Today] view. This shows recent 5 builds of selected project/branch or your following projects.

## SSH connect

`SSH` section will be shown while running SSH enabled builds if you installed SSH client which supports `ssh://` URI scheme such as Panic's [Prompt].

Launches SSH client when row of container was selected.

## Delete local artifacts

You can delete downloaded build artifacts from trash can icon which appears by swiping table rows left.

## Open application by URL

CI2Go now handles URI schemes: `chttps://`, `ci2go://`, `ci2go+https://`.

You can open CI2Go by replacing or prefixing protocol part of CircleCI build URL like:

[https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/frontend/3439] to [ci2go://circleci.com/gh/circleci/frontend/3439]
